# BankApp
This is a simple, front-end only, Banking Application designed for educational purposes. It provides an interface for a user to interact with a mock bank account. The application allows the user to deposit and withdraw money from a bank account and to check the account balance.

It is implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application responds to user interactions with appropriate feedback messages, validating input data and managing a simple state to emulate a bank account's functionality. The user can select an action (check balance, deposit, or withdraw), and depending on the action, an input field is available to input an amount.

The user's balance is stored in the local storage of the browser, which allows the balance to persist across different browsing sessions from the same browser. However, please note that this is a mock application for demonstration purposes only and does not interface with a real bank or handle real currency.

The source code is available on GitHub and serves as a useful learning resource for individuals getting started with front-end web development, providing insights into handling user events, interacting with the DOM, and managing application state on the client side.
